	<h1>How To Play Connect N</h1>
	<p>
		You will take turns with the computer putting pieces into columns 
		on the board. You will go first, and the computer will go second.
	</p>
	<p>
		To choose the column you want to put a piece in, simply click the 
		button above the column.
	</p>
	<p>
		The goal of the game is to connect a certain number of pieces in
		a row. This can be achieved horizontally, vertically, and
		diagonally.
	</p>
	<p>
		You may be wondering why the game is called "Connect N" as opposed
		to the classic "Connect 4". This is because there are 3 game modes:
		Small, Medium, and Large. The initial game mode is Medium. In order
		to change difficulty, navigate to the difficulty menu at the top left
		of the window.
	</p>
	<h2>Rules for each game mode:</h2>
	<p>
		For the Small mode, you need to connect 3 in a row to win. The 
		board will be a 4x5 grid.
	</p>
	<p>
		For the Medium mode, you need to connect 4 in a row to win. The 
		board will be a 6x7 grid.
	</p>
	<p>
		For the Large mode, you need to connect 5 in a row to win. The 
		board will be an 8x9 grid.
	</p>
	
	<p>Good luck!</p>
